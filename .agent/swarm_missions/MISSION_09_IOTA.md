# SWARM MISSION: AGENT IOTA (THE NETWORK)
**TARGET:** `meta/network_sim.py`
**OBJECTIVE:** Scale Network Simulation.

## CONTEXT
We need to simulate 100 nodes.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1.  **Modify `meta/network_sim.py`**:
    - Increase node count from 3 to 100.
    - Implement random churn (nodes joining/leaving).
    - Measure Block Propagation Time.

## CONSTRAINTS
- Ensure it runs within 30 seconds.
